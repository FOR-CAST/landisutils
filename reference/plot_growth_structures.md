# Plot mixtures against monocultures for one species

Shows what sharing a cell does to total aboveground carbon: the species
alone against every two-cohort mixture it appears in. This is the
question the single-species calibration cells cannot answer, since they
never let two cohorts compete for light.

## Usage

``` r
plot_growth_structures(summary, species, x_max = 100, max_panels = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- summary:

  A tibble from
  [`growth_structure_summary()`](https://for-cast.github.io/landisutils/reference/growth_structure_summary.md).

- species:

  Character. Modelled species code to plot.

- x_max:

  Numeric or `NULL`. Clip the data to this simulation year.

- max_panels:

  Integer or `NULL`. Keep only this many compositions, those with the
  most cells behind them. `NULL` (the default) keeps all, which is right
  when cells hold at most a couple of cohorts and a species appears in a
  handful of compositions. Where cells carry many age classes a species
  can appear in over a hundred, and a facet per composition renders as
  unreadable slivers with truncated strips. What was dropped is stated
  in the subtitle rather than left implied.

## Value

A ggplot, or `NULL` when the species appears in no composition.

## Details

The x axis is SIMULATION YEAR, not stand age. Unlike the verification
runs, which plant a single age-1 cohort, these cells start at the cohort
ages the initial-communities map actually carries, which can be several
centuries. A panel therefore begins at whatever carbon those cohorts
already hold, and a mid-run collapse is usually an old cohort reaching
`longevity` rather than anything the parameters did.
